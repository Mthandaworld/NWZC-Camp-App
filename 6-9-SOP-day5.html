          this girl went through Sister White’s bedroom on some errand, she saw
          something on the dresser she wanted very much. She stopped and looked
          at it. The longer she lingered, the more she felt she just had to have
          it. She looked this way and that, and seeing no one around she reached
          out her hand and took it. And what was it? A watch, or something
          valuable, you think? No. It was just a hairnet. The women at that time
          often wore a net over their hair. True, it was a well-made, silk
          hairnet. Sister White would not miss it, she thought, and it was just
          what she so much wanted. Leaving Sister White’s bedroom, with the
          hairnet in her closed hand, the young lady went to her bedroom and
          opening her trunk, put the net in the corner of the tray. She closed
          the trunk and went about her duties. But there was no song in her
          heart now. You know why.<o:p></o:p

          >A few hours later in the day, Sister White was preparing to go out,
          and entering her bedroom to get ready, she brushed her hair, and
          thought to put on the net, as was the custom of that day. But she
          could not find the net anywhere. It was not on the top of the dresser.
          She looked back of it, she looked under it, but could not find the
          missing article anywhere. Giving up, she did without it. That evening
          at worship time the girls gathered with Sister White around the open
          fireplace. Often Sister White, in connection with the worship, told a
          story of the early days. How they did enjoy these stories! But this
          evening, Sister White had a question to ask the girls. “Have any of
          you seen my hairnet?” she asked. Continuing, she said, “It was right
          there on my dresser in the bedroom. When I went to get it, it was
          gone. It must be found. It could not go away by itself.” But no one
          seemed to know about the hairnet, for no one responded. There was one
          girl there however, who wished Mrs. White would not say anything about
          a hairnet. The matter was dropped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"
            >&nbsp; </span
          >A day or two later, as Sister White was passing through this girl’s
          room, a voice spoke to her as she passed the trunk, “Lift the lid of
          that trunk!” But it was not Sister White’s trunk and she would not
          think of looking into someone else’s trunk.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes"
            >&nbsp; </span
          >Again the voice spoke to her, “Lift the lid of that trunk.”<o:p></o:p

          >Now she recognized the voice to be that of an angel, and she obeyed
          and opened the trunk. In the tray was the missing hairnet. She left it
          there, closed the trunk, and went about her tasks.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes"
            >&nbsp; </span
          >That evening, as the family came together again for worship, the
          hairnet question came up. “Does anyone know where the hairnet is?”
          Sister White asked. “I am sure it can be found. It could not go away
          by itself.” But there was no response, and no one seemed to know
          anything about the hairnet, Sister White did not press the matter
          further. One girl was worried and in her heart she determined to
          destroy the hairnet, lest Sister White should discover that she had
          taken it. How ungrateful this would seem!<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes"
            >&nbsp; </span
          >A few days after this, Sister White was seated in the living room in
          front of the fire in the fireplace, busy with her writing. It may have
          been a personal testimony she was writing to someone, or she may have
          been working on some of the last chapters of Great Controversy, For
          several hours she had been busy with her pen and her hand was tired,
          her mind was tired, and her eyes were tired. She laid her pen down and
          looked into the fireplace, and then just for a moment she was in
          vision. This was one of the shortest visions ever given to Sister
          White. <o:p></o:p

          >In this vision she saw the hand and arm of a girl. In the hand was a
          hairnet. She also saw on the table a kerosene lamp which was burning.
          She saw the hairnet held over the lamp and then lowered until the net
          touched the flame. In a flash of light, the silk net burned, and it
          was gone. The vision was over, and Sister White found herself in the
          living room by the open fire. Now she knew what had happened to the
          missing hairnet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That
          evening when the family was together around the fireplace, Sister
          White again asked about the hairnet. Did not someone know what had
          happened to it? Someone must know about it. But nothing was said; no
          one seemed to know. Sister White dropped the matter.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes"
            >&nbsp; </span
          >A little later Sister White called aside the girl in whose trunk she
          had seen the hairnet. She told her about the voice that spoke to her.
          She told her what she saw when she opened the trunk. Then she told her
          about the short vision and of how she saw the hairnet burn up over the
          lamp. <o:p></o:p

          >The girl broke down in tears. “Yes, Sister White, I took it,” she
          confessed. “I wanted it so much, and I did not think you would miss
          it, but when you began to press the matter I feared you would find out
          that I had taken it, so I held the net over a lamp and burned it up,
          just as you saw in the vision, and I said to myself, ‘Now no one will
          ever know about the hairnet.’’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"
            >&nbsp; </span
          >But someone was watching from up in heaven. The angels made a record
          of what took place, and God sent His angel down to this world with a
          vision for Sister White just about the hairnet. It was such a small
          thing for the Lord to bother about. God who created the earth and
          guides the planets, sent His angel down to this world with a vision
          for Sister White just about a hairnet a girl had taken. But it was a
          matter much more important than the value of the hairnet. Here was the
          soul of a young lady at stake.<o:p></o:p

          life—sins which led her to steal and to deceive. But when she saw that
          God loved her so much that He sent His angel down to this world with a
          vision for Sister White just about the hairnet, then she began to see
          some things differently. Some of the seemingly little things now

          Let the children "SEEK" for these Bible verses that tell us that Jesus
          is coming again. (Examples: Luke 12:40; Luke 21:27; Matt. 24:30-31;
          Matt. 24:44; Matt. 25:13; Matt. 16:27; John 14:1-3; Mark 8:38;I Thess.
          4:16.) Discuss that Jesus himself told us that he would return again
          and let the children read the Bible verse written on their slip.<o:p

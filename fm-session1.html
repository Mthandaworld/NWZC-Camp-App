      <h4>The Importance of Marriage and Family</h4>
      <p>
        God established marriage and family (Gen 2:18-24). God intended the
        marriage between Adam and Eve to be the pattern for all marriages
        throughout the ages. Christ endorsed this original concept by saying
        “Have ye not read that he who made them at the beginning made them male
        and female … for this reason shall a man leave his father and mother and
        shall cleave to his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh (Matt 19:5;
        Mk 10:7-8; Eph 5:31). entrance of sin in the world adversely affected
        marriage and the quality of relationship between husband and wife
        including children.<br />
        When Adam and Eve sinned, they lost the oneness they had known with each
        other and with God (Gen 3:6-24). Their relationship was marked with
        guilt, shame, blame, and pain. Wherever sin permeates, its sad effects
        is felt. These include: alienation, desertion, unfaithfulness, neglect,
        abuse, violence, separation, divorce etc. It is primary purpose of the
        gospel to restore humanity to its original status and that includes the
        marriage covenant.

      <p>
        No church, community, or nation will rise higher than the spiritual
        condition of its families. God designed the family as the birthplace and
        residence of Christianity. It is the place where the knowledge, fear,
        and love of the Lord are taught by parents and learned by children. The
        family is where character is planted and grown. It is the place where
        civility and respect for others are nurtured and cultivated. Family
        reveals the real you and provides the right platform for self-discovery
        and self-examination.<br />
        The impact of family on children and the future generations is
        tremendously far reaching. Perhaps this could be the reason why the
        Psalmist says, “I will walk within my house in the integrity of my
        heart.” Ps 101:2. Ellen G. White says, “The restoration and uplifting of
        humanity begins in the home. ... the well-being of society, the success
        of the church, the prosperity of the nation, depend upon home
        influence,” Ministry of Healing, 349.

        <li>Spiritual grooming (Heb 11:7; Job 1:5)</li>
        <li>Procreation -- family reproduction (Gen 1:23; Gen 2:24)</li>
        <li>
          Emotional Support -- emotional relations, companionship (Gen 2:18)
        </li>
        <li>
          Care -- providing security, stability and care of each other (1Tim
          5:8)
        </li>
        <li>
          Socialization -- teaching children to be obedient to the commands of
          God (Deut 6:4-8)
        </li>
        <li>Transmission of Values -- passing on family values (Deut 6:4-8)</li>
        <li>
          Identity -- establishing one’s identity, kinship and social status
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The function of the family as an evangelism hub is highlighted by David
        and Vera Mace, “The Christian home is, in fact, by far the most powerful
        evangelizing agency in the world. Its evangelism, however, is not
        aggressive; it is persuasive. It proclaims its message not by words, but
        by deeds. It does not tell others what they should be; it shows them
        what they could be. By their gracious influence, Christian homes win
        more converts than all the preachers put together. Give us enough of
        them, and the world would soon be a Christian world; for the world’s
        life rises to the higher levels only as its homes do so.” In The
        Presence of God, 113.

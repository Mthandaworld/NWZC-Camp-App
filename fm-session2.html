      <h4>God’s Design for Marriage and Family</h4>

      <ol>
        <li>
          God originated marriage, thus His law governs it (Gen. 2:18-24).
        </li>
        <li>
          God’s purpose for marriage is primarily companionship (Gen. 2:18).
        </li>
        <li>
          God’s secondary purpose for marriage is godly children (Mal. 2:15).
        </li>
        <li>
          God design for marriage is for two persons, male and female (Gen.
          2:23-24).
        </li>
        <li>
          God’s design for companionship requires commitment and intimacy (Ecl
          9:9)
        </li>
        <li>
          God considers the marriage covenant a life-long vow to Him (Mal. 2:14;
          Matt. 19:6).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        God celebrated the first marriage. Thus the institution has for its
        originator the Creator of the universe. "Marriage is honorable"; it was
        one of the first gifts of God to man, and it is one of the two
        institutions that, after the fall, Adam brought with him beyond the
        gates of Paradise. When the divine principles are recognized and obeyed
        in this relation, marriage is a blessing; it guards the purity and
        happiness of the race, it provides for man's social needs, it elevates
        the physical, the intellectual, and the moral nature. {AH 25.4}
      </p>

      <h4>Divinely Assigned Roles</h4>
      <p>
        God designed specific roles that need to be respected in a family
        setting. Disregard of the roles results in conflicts and confusion.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          1. Christ is the head of the man. Both the husband and the wife must
          recognize that Christ is the head of the home. Paul said that the man
          is the head of the woman but Christ is the head of the man (1
          Corinthians 11:3). That makes Christ the head of the household.
        </li>
        <li>
          2. The husband is the head of the wife. The Bible then teaches that
          the man is the head of the woman; the woman is to submit to the man (1
          Corinthians 11:3; Ephesians 5:22–24; Colossians 3:18; 1 Peter 3:1a).
          In 1 Corinthians 11:3, Paul says, “Now I want you to realize that the
          head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and
          the head of Christ is God.” And Ephesians 5:23 reads, “For the husband
          is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body,
          and is himself its Savior.” Unfortunately many husbands seem to have
          learned more about headship from the Pharaohs of Egypt than from the
          Lamb of God.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In God’s design is that the husband is to lead, provide, protect, and
        oversee his family.
      </p>
      <ul class="lesson-items" style="list-style-type: square; padding: 10px">
        <li>
          The Christian husband’s authority over his wife is modified by the
          fact that he himself is under the authority of Christ. Therefore, he
          cannot scripturally treat his wife in any way contrary to the
          teachings of Christ.
        </li>
        <li>
          The man’s headship is found in a context of mutual submission. Before
          Paul wrote that wives are to submit to their husbands in Ephesians
          5:22, he wrote that all Christians are to “be subject to one another”
          in Ephesians 5:21.
        </li>
        <li>
           The man’s headship is coupled with the requirement for him to love
          his wife as much as he loves himself and as much as he loves his own
          body. He is to love her as much as Christ loved the church (Ephesians
          5:25, 28, 33). How much did Christ love the church, His bride? Enough
          to die for her! Likewise, the husband is to lead the home; but he is
          to lead in such away as to follow the example of Christ, who died for
          the Church.

      <p>
        Biblical support for the idea that the man has the primary
        responsibility to protect and provide for his family is found in
        Deuteronomy 20:7-8 (men, not women, go forth to war—here and in many Old
        Testament passages); Deuteronomy 24:5; Joshua 1:14; Judges 4:8-10 (Barak
        does not get the glory, because he insisted that a woman accompany him
        into battle); Nehemiah 4:13-14 (the people are to fight for their
        brothers, homes, wives, and children, but it does not say they are to
        fight for their husbands!); Jeremiah 50:37 (it is the disgrace of a
        nation when its warriors become women); Nahum 3:13 (“Behold, your troops
        are women in your midst” is a taunt of derision); Matthew 2:13-14
        (Joseph is told to protect Mary and the infant Jesus by taking them to
        Egypt); Ephesians 5:25 (a husband’s love should extend even to a
        willingness to lay down his life for his wife, something many soldiers
        in battle have done throughout history to protect their families and
        homelands); 1 Peter 3:7 (a wife is a “weaker vessel,” and therefore the
        husband, as generally stronger, has a greater responsibility to use his
        strength to protect and provide for his wife).

        3. The wife is a helper. “Then the Lord God said, ‘It is not good that
        the man should be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him’”
        (Gen. 2:18). • God made one suitable helper for Adam, and she was female
        • Suitable helper – distinguished her from creatures named by man •
        Being a helper sums up her very reason of existence • The Hebrew word
        here translated “helper” (‘∑zer) is often used of God as our helper
        (e.g., Ps. 33:20; 70:5; 115:9). • Eve was created as a helper “fit for
        him” and a helper “corresponding to” him, one that is “adequate to him
        (Adam).”  Friend  Companion  One who compliments “Suitable Helper”
        means she is a • Helper • Producer • Incubator • Encourager • Receiver •
        Implementer The differect but complimentary roles are as follows He is
        the Head She is a Helper He is the Source She is an Incubator He is the
        Cultivator She is a Producer He is the Protector She is an Encourager He
        is the Developer She is a Receiver He is the Teacher She is an
        Implementer Biblical Injunctions on the Role of a Wife • Wives, submit
        to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the
        wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself
        its Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should
        submit in everything to their husbands Eph 5:22-23. • Likewise, wives,
        be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the
        word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives, when
        they see your respectful and pure conduct 1 Pet 3: 1-2 To be subject to
        her husband as… As unto the Lord - Disciple Eph 5:22 As church is to
        Christ - Follower Eph 5:24 As Sarah obeyed Abraham 1 Peter 3:6 As
        fitting in the Lord Col 3:18 In Titus 2:3–5, Paul calls for the older
        Christian women to instruct the younger women “to be sober, to love
        their husbands, to love their children, to be discreet, chaste, keepers
        at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be
        not blasphemed.” 4. Children are to obey their parents. The Bible
        teaches that children must be obedient to their parents (Ephesians
        6:1–3). The husband and wife who are trying to build their home on the
        foundation of God and His Word must, therefore, reject any parenting
        theory that denies parents the right to direct, teach, and discipline
        their children. They must require their children to obey them.

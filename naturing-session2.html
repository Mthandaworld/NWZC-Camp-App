          The new members must be helped to discover and use their spiritual

          4:11-15) in mid-week prayer meetings where there are non-threatening

            Unfortunately some spiritual parents have not taken seriously their
            responsibility to disciple the new converts. The new converts have
            been left alone either to swim or to sink.
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
              >This is spiritual baby-dumping.</i
            >
            Some Adventist churches have left the nurturing of new convert to
            the fishers of man class which meets for lessons once a week on the
            Sabbath. The lessons held on Sabbath are not adequate to make
            disciples. Many local church leaders seem to think that more lessons
            on fundamental beliefs will disciple people. In order to produce
            genuine disciples the church needs more that teaching Bible lessons.
            The new convert should learn the Bible stories and verses. The new
            converts should also learn to apply the knowledge of the Bible in
            real life as they observe how their spiritual parents live out the
            Christian life. The new believers should also observe how their
            mentors struggle to earn a living in an economically unstable
            environment. Pauls mentees must have observed him as he went from
            house to house conducting Bible studies (Acts 20:20) during the day.
            They must have observed how he would make tents at night (1
            Thessalonians 1:9-10) which were later sold. They also noted that he
            refused financial assistance. In that way he was different from
            those who preached for gain.<o:p></o:p></span
